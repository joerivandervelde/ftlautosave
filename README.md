# ftlautosave
Autosave program for FTL Faster Than Light, simply backs the save files up as they are updated.

-- Description --

Faster Than Light continuously changes the profile and the save-file of the player (ae_prof.sav and continue.sav) but does not allow keeping saves / reverting back to an old save. This program circumvents that by monitoring the two save-files and creating a backup copy every time one of them changes.

-- Usage --

Right now it has to be run directly in FTL's save folder, requires Java 8 to run. Check the releases if you need a pre-compiled jar, further instructions are attached in a readme in the release-zip.
